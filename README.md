[FWRTSS](https://www.ynsta.org/fwrtss/doc/html/fwrtss.html) is an open source hardware and software project of a temperature controlled soldering station designed to be used with Weller RT soldering tips.

The majority of the software used to build and debug this project are also open source:

 - KiCad (5126) for PCB design with the [amazing new interactive router from CERN team](http://www.ohwr.org/projects/cern-kicad/wiki/WorkPackages).

 - ARM cross GCC (4.8.3) & binutils,

 - GDB cross, stlink,

 - dfu-util,

 - python, pyside, pyqtgraph,

 - scons, make

 - asciidoc,

 - emacs,

 - ...

The main goal of this project was to teach myself some new stuffs as it is my first real project with a stm32 MCU and also my first surface mount PCB project with 0.5mm pitch components.
